# # Euler Method with Theorems Applied to Non-Linear Population Equations
#  
# 
# The more general form of a first order Ordinary Differential Equation is: 
# $$
# y^{'}=f(t,y).
# $$
# This can be solved analytically by integrating both sides but this is not straight forward for most problems.
# Numerical methods can be used to approximate the solution at discrete points.
# In this notebook we will work through the Euler method for two initial value problems:
# 
# 1. A non-linear population equation 
# $$
# y‚Ä≤=0.2ùë¶‚àí0.01y^2 
# $$
# 
# 
# 2.
# 

# ## Euler method
# 
# The simplest one step numerical method is the Euler Method named after the most prolific of mathematicians [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) (15 April 1707 ‚Äì 18 September 1783) .
# 
# The general Euler formula to the first order equation
# $$
# y^{'} = f(t,y) 
# $$
# approximates the derivative at time point $t_i$
# $$
# y^{'}(t_i) \approx \frac{w_{i+1}-w_i}{t_{i+1}-t_{i}} 
# $$
# where $w_i$ is the approximate solution of $y$ at time $t_i$.
# This substitution changes the differential equation  into a __difference__ equation of the form 
# $$ 
# \frac{w_{i+1}-w_i}{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}=f(t_i,w_i) 
# $$
# Assuming uniform stepsize $t_{i+1}-t_{i}$ is replaced by $h$, re-arranging the equation gives
# $$ 
# w_{i+1}=w_i+hf(t_i,w_i),$$
#  This can be read as the future $w_{i+1}$ can be approximated by the present $w_i$ and the addition of the input to the system $f(t,y)$ times the time step.

# # Non-linear population equation
# 
# The general form of the non-linear population growth differential equation is: 
# $$ y^{'}=\alpha y-\beta y^2 $$
# where $\alpha$ is the growth rate and $\beta$ is the death rate. The initial population at time $ a $ is 
# $$ y(a)=A $$
# $$ a\leq t \leq b. $$
# 
# ## Specific non-linear population equation 
# Given the growth rate $$\alpha=0.2,$$ and death rate $$\beta=0.01,$$ giving the specific differential equation,
# $$ y^{'}=0.2 y-0.01 y^2 $$
# The initial population at time $2000$ is 
# $$ y(2000)=6, $$
# we are interested in the time period
# $$ 2000\leq t \leq 2020. $$
# 
# ## Initial Condition
# To get a specify solution to a first order initial value problem, an __initial condition__ is required.
# For our population problem the initial population is 6 billion people:
# $$y(2000)=6.$$
# 
# ## General Discrete Interval
# The continuous time $a\leq t \leq b $ is discretised into $N$ points seperated by a constant stepsize
# $$ h=\frac{b-a}{N}.$$
# ## Specific Discrete Interval
# Here the interval is $2000\leq t \leq 2020$ with $N=200$ 
# $$ h=\frac{2020-2000}{200}=0.1.$$
# This gives the 201 discrete points with stepsize h=0.1:
# $$ t_0=2000, \ t_1=0.1, \ ... t_{200}=2020. $$
# This is generalised to 
# $$ t_i=2000+i0.1, \ \ \ i=0,1,...,200.$$
# The plot below illustrates the discrete time steps from 2000 to 2002.

t_end=2020.0

# ## Numerical approximation of Population growth
# The differential equation is transformed using the Euler method into a difference equation of the form
#       $$ w_{i+1}=w_{i}+h (\alpha w_i-\beta w_i\times w_i). $$
# This approximates a series of of values $w_0, \ w_1, \ ..., w_{N}$.
# For the specific example of the population equation the difference equation is,
#       $$ w_{i+1}=w_{i}+h 0.1 [0.2 w_i-0.01 w_i\times w_i], $$
# where $i=0,1,2,...,199$, and $w_0=6$. From this initial condition the series is approximated.
#

w[0]=6
for i in range (0,N):
    w[i+1]=w[i]+h*(0.2*w[i]-0.01*w[i]*w[i])

# ## Numerical Error
# With a numerical solution there are two types of error: 
# * local truncation error at one time step; 
# * global error which is the propagation of local error. 
# 
# ### Derivation of  Euler Local truncation error
# The left hand side of a initial value problem $\frac{dy}{dt}$ is approximated by __Taylors theorem__ expand about a point $t_0$ giving:
# \begin{equation}y(t_1) = y(t_0)+(t_1-t_0)y^{'}(t_0) + \frac{(t_1-t_0)^2}{2!}y^{''}(\xi), \ \ \ \ \ \ \xi \in [t_0,t_1]. \end{equation}
# Rearranging and letting $h=t_1-t_0$ the equation becomes
# $$y^{'}(t_0)=\frac{y(t_1)-y(t_0)}{h}-\frac{h}{2}y^{''}(\xi). $$
# From this the local truncation error is
# $$\tau \leq \frac{h}{2}M  $$
# where $y^{''}(t) \leq M $.
# #### Derivation of  Euler Local truncation error for the Population Growth
# As the exact solution $y$ is unknown we cannot get an exact estimate of the second derivative
# $$y'(t)=0.2 y-0.01 y^2,$$
# differentiate with respect to $t$,
# $$y''(t)=0.2 y'-0.01 (2yy'),$$
# subbing the original equation gives 
# $$y''(t)=0.2 (0.2 y-0.01 y^2)-0.01 \big(2y(0.2 y-0.01 y^2)\big),$$
# which expresses the second derivative as a function of the exact solution $y$, this is still a problem as the value of $y$ is unknown, to side step this issue we assume the population is between $0<y<20$ this gives
# $$max|y''|=M\leq 0.8,$$
# this gives a local trucation for $h=0.1$ for our non-linear equation is
# $$\tau=\frac{h}{2}0.8=0.04. $$
#

plt.xlabel('time')
plt.ylim([0,0.1])
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.title('Local Truncation Error')
plt.plot();


# ### Global truncation error for the population equation
# For the population equation specific values $L$ and $M$ can be calculated.
# 
# In this case $f(t,y)=\epsilon y$ is continuous and satisfies a Lipschitz Condition with constant
# $$ \left|\frac{\partial f(t,y)}{\partial y}\right|\leq L $$
# $$ \left|\frac{\partial (0.2 y-0.01 y^2)}{\partial y}\right|\leq |0.2-0.01(2\times y)| \leq |0.2-0.01(2\times 50)|\leq 0.8 $$
# 
# on $D=\{(t,y)|2000\leq t \leq 2015, 0 < y < 50 \}$ and that a constant $M$
# exists with the property that 
# $$ |y^{''}(t)|\leq M\leq 6. $$
# 
# __ Specific Theorem Global Error__
# 
# Let $y(t)$ denote the unique solution of the Initial Value Problem
# $$ y^{'}=0.2 y-0.01 y^2, \ \ \ 2000\leq t \leq 2020, \ \ \ y(0)=6, $$
# and $w_0,w_1,...,w_N$ be the approx generated by the Euler method for some
# positive integer N.  Then for $i=0,1,...,N$ the error is:
# $$ |y(t_i)-w_i| \leq \frac{6 h}{2\times 0.8}|e^{0.8(t_i-2000)}-1|. $$
# 

# # Non-linear population equation with a temporal oscilation 
# Given the specific population differential equation with a wiggle,
# $$ y^{'}=0.2 y-0.01 y^2+sin(2\pi t), $$
# with the initial population at time $2000$ is 
# $$ y(2000)=6, $$
# $$ 2000\leq t \leq 2020. $$
# 
# For the specific example of the population equation the difference equation is
#       $$ w_{i+1}=w_{i}+h 0.5 (0.2 w_i-0.02 w_i\times w_i+sin(2 \pi t), $$
# for $i=0,1,...,199$,
# where $w_0=6$. From this initial condition the series is approximated.
# The figure below shows the discrete solution.
